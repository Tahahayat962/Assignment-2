<h2>Learning How to Drive a Car</h2>
<p>I learnt how to drive quite late, when I was 18, it was good to learn how to operate a vehicle</p>
<p>and my favorite memory was almost crashing my friend's car after assuring him that I could drive</p>
<p>with only a day of practice. I don't enjoy the traffic but it feels cathartic to drive so I give it an A .</p>
