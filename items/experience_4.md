<h2>Learning CSS/html</h2>
<p>I learnt coding in the last 2-3 weeks and it has been going well, I believe it is a very valuable skill</p>
<p>for my future. Myfavorite memory was incorporating colors into webpages for the first time and realizing</p>
<p>how much creative control you have when it comes to webpages. I still don't like how confusing some.</p>
<p>codes can be. I give it an A overall.</p>
