## Learning how to use Microsoft Excel

I have only properly learnt excel in the last 2 weeks and it is very simple for the most part

it is good to be able to visualize your data and it's a skill that holds a lot of value I believe

I don't have a specific favorite memory but being able to chart data was a little exciting at first

but excel doesn't always respond the way I want it to and that is annoying but still tolerable.

I give the experience a B.
